Analogizer Amiga Core for the Analogue Pocket:
==============================================
* [0.3.1] **Analogizer** support added by **RndMnkIII** and based on **mazamars312** Analogue Pocket - Commodore Amiga - 0.2.1. See more in the Analogizer main repository: [Analogizer](https://github.com/RndMnkIII/Analogizer) [31/01/2025].


This Analogizer core is the first to use a configuration file to select Analogizer adapter options, not based on the Pocket's menu system. It is necessary to run an external  [utility](https://github.com/RndMnkIII/AnalogizerConfigurator)  to generate such a file. Once generated, you must copy the `analogizer.bin` file to the `/Assets/analogizer/common` folder on the Pocket SD card. If this folder does not exist, you must create it or if you have already extracted the Amiga core distribution file it will be created.

This utility allows you to do a few things beyond the usual SNAC controller type and assignment, or video output type and blackout of the Pocket screen. You can also have the Amiga core OSD menu displayed on the Pocket screen itself or via the Analogizer video output. If you choose to use PSX SNAC with a controller with analog sticks, as the Dual Shock/Dual Shock 2, you will be able to control the mouse pointer within the Amiga operating system.

I have tried not to have to remove any of the features of the Amiga core port for the Pocket but in the end the size restrictions of the FPGA have forced me to disable the 4400Hz LPF audio filter. Of all the core features I hope this is the least noticeable, in any case I apologize if this is not to the liking of all users.

The Analogizer interface allow to mix game inputs from compatible SNAC gamepads supported by Analogizer (DB15 Neogeo, NES, SNES, PCEngine, PSX) with Analogue Pocket built-in controls or from Dock USB or wireless supported controllers (Analogue support).

All Analogizer adapter versions (v1, v2 and v3) has a side slide switch labeled as 'A B' that must be configured based on the used SNAC game controller.
For example for use it with PSX Dual Shock or Dual Shock 2 native gamepad you must position the switch lever on the B side position. For the remaining
game controllers you must switch the lever on the A side position. 
Be careful when handling this switch. Use something with a thin, flat tip such as a precision screwdriver with a 2.0mm flat blade for example. Place the tip on the switch lever and press gently until it slides into the desired position:
```
     ---
   B|O  |A  A/B switch on position B
     ---   
     ---
   B|  O|A  A/B switch on position A
     ---
``` 

**Analogizer** is responsible for generating the correct encoded Y/C signals from RGB and outputs to R,G pins of VGA port. Also redirects the CSync to VGA HSync pin.
The required external Y/C adapter that connects to VGA port is responsible for output Svideo o composite video signal using his internal electronics. Oficially
only the Mike Simone Y/C adapters (active) designs will be supported by Analogizer and will be the ones to use.

Adapted to **Analogizer** by [@RndMnkIII](https://github.com/RndMnkIII).
Support native PCEngine/TurboGrafx-16 2btn, 6 btn gamepads and 5 player multitap using SNAC adapter
and PC Engine cable harness (specific for Analogizer). Many thanks to [Mike Simone](https://github.com/MikeS11/MiSTerFPGA_YC_Encoder) for his great Y/C Encoder project.

You will need to connect an active VGA to Y/C adapter to the VGA port (the 5V power is provided by VGA pin 9). I'll recomend one of these (active):
* [MiSTerAddons - Active Y/C Adapter](https://misteraddons.com/collections/parts/products/yc-active-encoder-board/)
* [MikeS11 Active VGA to Composite / S-Video](https://ultimatemister.com/product/mikes11-active-composite-svideo/)
* [Active VGA->Composite/S-Video adapter](https://antoniovillena.com/product/mikes1-vga-composite-adapter/)

Using another type of Y/C adapter not tested to be used with Analogizer will not receive official support.

I'll recomend also read this guide for MiSTer FPGA but can applied to Analogizer:

Analogue Pocket - Commodore Amiga - 0.2.1
=========================================

The Commodore Amiga was a personal computer that replaced the well-loved Commodore 64 in the Commodore product line. It also was one of the many 68K-based personal computers that showed that this CPU was a powerhouse when integrated with additional great hardware.

This is based on the MiSTer Github of the Amiga MiST project (Also known as Minimig) and the VexRISCV RISC-V chip for the Media Processing Unit (MPU) between the core and APF framework for floppy, hard drive and CD-ROM access.

This core works best with the [AmigaVision](https://amiga.vision/) configurations.

Will only work on Analogue OS firmware 2.1 and now works with the default AmigaVision harddrive image, no Pocket-specific version required anymore!

Support for >4GB hard drive images LBA48 has been turned on in the MPU and Analogue Firmware and the `data.json` file now has this as the `MegaAGS.hdf` as the default hard drive image to load.

If you are upgrading from an earlier version of the Amiga core with AmigaVision installed: `MegaAGS-Pocket.hdf` is no longer referenced in the `data.json` file, so if you want to use the smaller setup instead of downloading the full version, just rename the image file. But we recommend getting the full version to have access to all the games and demos.

What can it do?
---------------

-   Both 68000 and 68020 CPUs

-   Chip memory 512kB, 1MB, 1.5MB and 2MB

-   Slow memory none, 512kB, 1MB, 1.5MB

-   Fast memory of none/2/4/8MB for the 68000 CPU

-   Fast memory of 16/32MB for the 68020 CPU setup

-   AGA Chipset

-   Turbo boot

-   LBA48 enabled - It can read and write to ADF disk images (floppy disks) up to 2Tbytes now!

-   Can also access up to 4 Harddrive HDF files

How to setup
------------

-   Place your ADF and HDF images in the `\Assets\amiga\common` folder.

-   Place the Kickstart BIOS rom in the `\Assets\amiga\common` folder (Any original 256/512/1024kB firmware ROM will work - no encrypted BIOSes yet). Currently `MegaAGS-Kickstart.rom` is the default rom

-   Make sure that the `\Assets\amiga\Mazamars312.Amiga\` Folder has the `amiga_mpu_bios.bin` file - this is supplied and should already be there.

-   When changing system configurations, you must select the "CPU reset" in the menu to apply the config.

-   All harddrive and floppy images are to be placed into the `\Assets\amiga\common`

-   For harddrive images - In the `\Cores\Mazamars312.Amiga\` folder, the `data.json` file would need to be edited with the files names for each HDF file placed in data slots 310-313. By default, the AmigaVision images are referenced, but you can change the names for other hard drives. These cannot be changed on the fly due to how the HDF images work in the core. They are now limited to 2TB drives. Anything larger will need different sector sizes to run.

-   If HDD3 or HDD4 are needed make sure your Kickstart has been patched to support this, or install AtapiMagic/IDEFix97. This is not a Pocket Core/MPU issue, but a limitation of AmigaOS from back in the day.

How can I get AmigaVision running on this core?
-----------------------------------------------

For this you are required to have the following 3 files to place in to the `\Assets\amiga\common` folder

-   The Kickstart ROM - `MegaAGS-Kickstart.rom`

-   The Main Hard drive image - `MegaAGS.hdf`

-   The Save Hard drive image - `MegaAGS-Saves.hdf`

The recommended settings in the interact menu are as follows:

-   FDD/HDD LED = Off

-   Port 1/Port 2 = Mouse/CD32PAD

-   Mouse Speed = 10

-   System Config = AGA/Turbo/PAL

-   CPU Type 68020 CPU - No Cache

-   memory - Chip = 2Mb

-   memory - Slow = None

-   memory - Fast = 32Mbytes

-   Audio Filter = A500/PWM

-   Audio Mix = 50%

These can also be defaulted by selecting "Reset all to Default" in the interaction menu

Is the best way to play this using the Dock?
--------------------------------------------

-   Yes, as you can then fully use the keyboard and mouse to interface with the core. Just make sure you select Port1/Port2 as Mouse/Joystick1 or Mouse/CD32 when using the real mouse (The new APF firmware has been found to have a bug with the mouse plugged in - am awaiting for an update on this).

-   Also the mouse is emulated on the left analogue thumb stick at the same time as joypad 1 is being used

-   Be aware that you will need a controller to access the Menu if you want to make changes.

-   The mouse needs some more work on the clamping and timing for it to work with every mouse. The current mouse I have is a lower sensitivity mouse and I find that it works fine, but high res based mice will cause the mouse to fly off in random locations. Work will be done more once the MPU has some resources changed in it

-   Have fixed up the Mouse input when a joystick was connected to the dock after has been release on the pocket firmware.

Menu Listing
------------

-   Load Bios - This will allow you to reload new BIOSes on the fly - will cause a reset.

-   Load Floppy Drive 0-1 - This will allow you to load different floppies while playing. Yes I had to drop this down as there was not enough space in the menus

-   CPU Reset - This will reset the core, and any change in settings will be applied.

-   FDD/HDD LED - this places a FDD or HDD activity light on the screen. The HDD light stays on some times unknown why yet.

-   Floppy Drives - this will allow you to select how many drives are installed, and delimit the transfer rate of the Amiga core.

-   Port 1/Port 2 - This allows you to change and swap the controller ports with CD32/Normal Joysticks/Mouse - if you need to use the emulated mouse, make sure you use the mouse/joystick or mouse/CD32 options.

-   Mouse Speed - This will change the update rate of both the emulated and real mouse movements.

-   Screen Movement X/Y - Moves the screen around.

-   System Config - Allows you to select PAL/NTSC refresh, OG (original) hardware or the AGA (Advanced Graphics Architecture) hardware, Turbo Boot or standard boot modes.

-   CPU Type - Allows you which type of CPU you want installed 68000, 68010, 68020 with no cache, 68020 with cache.

-   Memory: Chip - Size of the Chip memory.

-   Memory: Slow - Size of the slow memory.

-   Memory: Fast - on the 68000 and 68010 CPU this is none/2/4/8MB, on the 68020 this is 16 or 32.

-   Audio Filter: there are 4 options - A500 or A1200 filters with or without PWM

-   Audio Mixer: This will mix the left and right audio streams together. This defaults to 50%

Is there an emulated mouse while not connected to the dock?
-----------------------------------------------------------

-   Yes, you can toggle this with the start button, and the D-pad becomes the movement, and the buttons are emulated on the left and right triggers.

-   Please note that you need to have the Port1/Port2 setup as Mouse/Joystick1 or Mouse/CD32 for the mouse to work.

Is there an emulated Keyboard?
------------------------------

-   Yes, now there is! Press the Select button and a OSD keyboard will come up. There are no double pressed buttons yet.

Can we write to floppy disks at this moment?
--------------------------------------------

-   Yes you now can. So make sure you want to write to your images when they are on here!

Wait, you have another CPU in the FPGA?
---------------------------------------

-   Yes, the MPU is a VexRISCV CPU configured with a small footprint to interface with the APF interface to the HPS bus currently in the MiSTer Amiga core.

Specs:

-   Running at 74.2MHz (Same as the APF bus).

-   Connected to the core via a 16bit HPS Bus.

-   Two timers - one for interrupts and the other for user timing.

-   Currently, 128KB of memory/RAM for the MPU's program and buffers

-   Work on interrupts and using a PSRAM chip is needed on the next steps

How did you speed up load times
-------------------------------

-   Through talking to the Analogue techs, it is faster to buffer more data and have that ready for the core to use then smaller 512 chunks that the original code would do. This is affected by the block size of the SD card Formats and also if you use FAT32 or NTFS.

Why are some of the resolutions not correct?
--------------------------------------------

-   Current the standard Amiga resolutions for both the OCS and AGA work. Special ECS resolutions like 1024x200 or 1024x400 will not, since the max resolution of the Analogue Pocket is 800x720.

-   Due to memory access, the RTG resolutions will not work on this right now. They are also not used in the AmigaVision list of games

I have game X that does not work!
---------------------------------

-   A few games only work from ADF floppy images with the exact correct version of Kickstart.

-   The main goal of this project was getting an MPU Framework so external media can be accessed, and help giving developers some tools to help create more cores on the Pocket.

-   I do expect that there is more to learn about the Amiga to get many of these bugs resolved.

-   For multi-disk games, also try putting disks in other drives. Make sure you change the amount of installed drives to the amount needed. (Up to 2)

-   Found that the ICACHE system in the core was causing re-reads while a DMA was happening. Have corrected this and now the AmigaVision games work as well as they do on MiSTer.

AmigaVision does not start up and only a black screen is there
---------------------------------------------------------------

The Amiga Vision requires a 68020 CPU, AGA Chipset and extra memory to run. Make sure you do a "Reset all to Default" to get the core to boot.

Change since 0.1.2 to 0.2.1
---------------------------

-   ICACHE Fixed for WDLOADER to work correctly

-   LBA48 added to support larger HDD images to 2TB in size

-   The joysticks are completely disabled when using the emulated mouse or keyboard

-   Audio Mixing - Still some work to be done here to get rid of the snap or pops from the lower frequencies to 48kHz

-   Some changes to the caching for the MPU to speed up some processes

Change since 0.1.0 to 0.1.2
---------------------------

-   Just getting the mouse working on the dock

-   Thanks to Analogue fixing up the line bug that was found with this core on the dock.

Change since 0.0.6 to 0.1.0
---------------------------

-   Hard Drive support for the Pocket

-   Proper 640x400/200 video outputs work!

-   Write to floppy images

-   More memory for the fast memory locations and tested working correctly.

-   Larger memory footprint for the MPU to hold all this awesomeness!!! 128KBYTE OF POWER!

-   A OSD Keyboard on the pocket when you are playing on pocket mode.

-   Null modem support using a Gameboy serial cable between two pockets! This could also open up MIDI support.

-   Also a emulated mouse on a analogue joystick in docked mode (This is the left thumb stick and the left and right triggers for the mouse clicks)

-   Dropped the floppy drives from 4 to 2 as there was not enough room in the interation menu at this moment.

Change since 0.0.5 to 0.0.6
---------------------------

-   Interlace mode corrected for games like DarkSeed.

-   Folder names changed for Unix/Linux/Mac OS and to help with the uploader system.

-   Faster floppy access times using a larger buffer in the MPU core and caching.

-   But what about the things below? I wanted to sort out these key issues out first and I'm awaiting a bugfix from Analogue to be released. This is due to files being corrupted when writing back to disk.

What will be the next update?
-----------------------------

-   Clock input for the Amiga to keep its time.

-   I have to find out why swapping disks will not always work.
